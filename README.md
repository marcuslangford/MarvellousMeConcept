# MarvellousMeConcept

# Intro

This is my final year Computer Science project at the University of Portsmouth. 

My design for the application 'Marvellous Me' is focused around solving issues with the current design and 
bringing new features to the application. I decided on using the Meteor platform to develop an application using javascript for
Android and ios. Meteor comes equipped with Mongo DB and uses Atmospherejs.com as a package management system, you are also able
to use other package managers such as NPM. 


# Instructions

1. In the project root run 'meteor npm install --save @babel/runtime' - This is to avoid having the Node-Module folder on the 
   repository but hopefully a temporary solution. 
2. Execute 'Meteor run' or 'Meteor' in the root of the project file after download
   This will also start Mongo DB which you can connect to from another terminal using 'Meteor Mongo' also from the root
   Note - Running from a mobile device is possible with installed software (Android sdk OR mac + xcode). More info at

3. Go to localhost:3000 and switch to mobile view. You can also connect to the local host on a mobile device by finding the
   ip-address of your machine and going to the address in the mobile browser.
